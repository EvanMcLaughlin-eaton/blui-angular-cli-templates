This is an official Brightlayer UI template for use with the [Brightlayer UI CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/cli).

This template installs the basic Brightlayer UI libraries for themes and components and configures the application to use them. It includes a simple placeholder screen that you can replace with your own application content.

## Usage

```sh
npx -p @brightlayer-ui/cli blui new angular --name=myapp --template=blank
```
