![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@pxblue/angular-template-routing?color=%23007bc1&label=%40pxblue%2Fangular-template-routing)

This is an official PX Blue template for use with the [PX Blue CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pxblue/cli).

This template installs the basic PX Blue libraries for themes and components and configures the application to use them. It includes a drawer implementation with basic routing.

## Usage
```sh
npx -p @pxblue/cli pxb new angular --name=myapp --template=routing
```
